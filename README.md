# Algorithmic
The course was imparted in the University of Granada, which consist on the optimization of time or other factors

## First Practice
Consist on the optimization of time to sort arrays of n elements [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/Sorting_Arrays%20/algoritmica.pdf)

## Second Practice
Consist on the optimization of time to sort arrays but applying divide and conquer [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/Divide%20and%20Conquer/presentacionP2.pdf)

## Third Practice
Consist on the optimization of time applying an algorithm greedy which is not perfect to choose the best option, but the time is minimu [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/Greedy%20algorithms/Pr%C3%A1ctica%203_%20Algoritmos%20Voraces%20(Greedy).pdf)

## Fourth Pracitce
This is the common problem called the travelman sales problem to optimize the length to be the minimun, applying greedy algorithms [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/Travelman%20Sales%20problem/Presentaci%C3%B3n.pdf)

## Fifth Practice
This problem is to divide a group of people in two subteams of equals or the most equal number of people, applying a tree with prune and without it [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/Tree%20optimiaztion/Divisi%C3%B3n%20en%20dos%20equipos.pdf)

## Sixth Practice
This is the same problem of the fourth practice but instead of applying a greedy algorithm using a tree with backtracking [memoir](https://github.com/jmrCalvo/Algorithmic/blob/master/tree%20backtracking/Pr%C3%A1ctica%204%E2%80%9CAlgoritmos%20de%20Vuelta%20Atr%C3%A1s%20(Backtracking)%20y%20de%20Ramificaci%C3%B3n%20y%20Poda%20(Branch%20and%20Bound)%E2%80%9D.pdf)
